## Project: IntelliBrary

IntelliBrary is a desktop library management application used for library administrators to manage books. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature** view the `Stocking` of a book (pull requests [#80](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-3/tp/pull/80))
    * What it does: allows the librarian to view the stocking of a book in every location.
    * Justification: This feature provides a useful service for the librarian to estimate whether the current stocking of a book is enough and whether the library should purchase more copies of the book to satisfy the reader need.

* **New Feature** add, view, delete, and edit the `Review` of a book (pull requests [#126](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-3/tp/pull/126) [#213](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-3/tp/pull/213) [#231](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-3/tp/pull/231) [#237](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-3/tp/pull/237) [#244](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-F09-3/tp/pull/244))
    * What it does: allows the librarian to record rating and feedback from the readers and estimate the popularity of the book.
    * Justification: This feature provides the means for librarian to evaluate the quality of the books as well as the need and appetite of the readers, helping the decision of future book purchase.
